# ProtonMail-Username-Checker
ProtonMail Available Username Checker

## Installation
```bash
pip install requests
pip install colorama
```

## Usage
Manual checking - Option 1
List checking - Option 2
 
 ## Warning
 Some unavailable usernames may be flagged as Available. I havent really found a fix to this yet.
 This may mean the account has been blocked by ProtonMail previously.
